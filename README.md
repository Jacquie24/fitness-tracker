# Fitness Tracker

## Description
Fitness Tracker is designed to allow the user to enter a workout, either cardio or resistance, and record the number of minutes and reps.  The tracker will provide the totals of the last workout on the main page, and then a summary of the last seven days on the dashboard.  This assignment was designed to make use of a noSQL database, MongoDB, with the Mongoose package, then using Atlas to deploy the database on Heroku.

Run the node seeders/seeds.js file to incorporate prewritten data or run with npm start and add workouts manually on the local server.
